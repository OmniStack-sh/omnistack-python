        openai protocol chat completions

        Args:
          messages: A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_format_inputs_to_chatgpt_models).

          model: ID of the model to use. See the
              [model endpoint compatibility](/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility) table
              for details on which models work with the Chat API.

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

              [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/guides/text-generation/parameter-details)

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

              Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model
              will not call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model
              can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a
              particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that
              function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          functions: Deprecated in favor of `tools`.

              A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

              Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the
              tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the
              bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact
              effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or
              increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban
              or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true,
              returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of
              `message`.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat
              completion.

              The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's
              context length.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken)
              for counting tokens.

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that
              you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the
              choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.

          omni_params: A dictionary for passing additional parameters specific to Omni's requirements.
              This can include various types of values such as strings, integers, floats, or
              booleans.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

              [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/guides/text-generation/parameter-details)

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output. Compatible with
              [GPT-4o](/docs/models/gpt-4o), [GPT-4o mini](/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini),
              [GPT-4 Turbo](/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo) and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models
              newer than `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured
              Outputs which guarantees the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn
              more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the
              message the model generates is valid JSON.

              **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to
              produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may
              generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token
              limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that
              the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which
              indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the
              max context length.

          seed: This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
              sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
              parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
              should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
              in the backend.

          service_tier: Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is
              relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

              - If set to 'auto', the system will utilize scale tier credits until they are
                exhausted.
              - If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service
                tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
              - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

              When this parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier`
              utilized.

          stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

          stream: If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be
              sent as data-only
              [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format)
              as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]`
              message.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic.

              We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to
              return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.
              `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
              and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).

        Args:
          messages: A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_format_inputs_to_chatgpt_models).

          model: ID of the model to use. See the
              [model endpoint compatibility](/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility) table
              for details on which models work with the Chat API.

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

              [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/guides/text-generation/parameter-details)

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

              Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model
              will not call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model
              can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a
              particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that
              function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          functions: Deprecated in favor of `tools`.

              A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

              Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the
              tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the
              bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact
              effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or
              increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban
              or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true,
              returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of
              `message`.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat
              completion.

              The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's
              context length.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken)
              for counting tokens.

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that
              you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the
              choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.

          omni_params: A dictionary for passing additional parameters specific to Omni's requirements.
              This can include various types of values such as strings, integers, floats, or
              booleans.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

              [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/guides/text-generation/parameter-details)

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output. Compatible with
              [GPT-4o](/docs/models/gpt-4o), [GPT-4o mini](/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini),
              [GPT-4 Turbo](/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo) and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models
              newer than `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured
              Outputs which guarantees the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn
              more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the
              message the model generates is valid JSON.

              **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to
              produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may
              generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token
              limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that
              the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which
              indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the
              max context length.

          seed: This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
              sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
              parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
              should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
              in the backend.

          service_tier: Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is
              relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

              - If set to 'auto', the system will utilize scale tier credits until they are
                exhausted.
              - If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service
                tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
              - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

              When this parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier`
              utilized.

          stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

          stream: If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be
              sent as data-only
              [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format)
              as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]`
              message.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic.

              We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to
              return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.
              `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
              and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).
